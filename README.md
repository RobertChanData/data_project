# Spotify Project

#### Project Overview
This project is part of my Master's program: "Machine Learning I".

Spotify's music streaming service allows users to create personalized playlists and manage family accounts.  
Due to a server hack, data regarding `user` and `top_year` for some songs were deleted.  
The task is to:
 - Reconstruct the Top-of-the-Year playlists for each user from 2018 to 2024 using the available data
 - Reconstruct the missing user: Recover the missing songs for each userâ€™s playlist

#### Project summary

The Jupyter Notebook is structured in 5 ways:
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
2. Data Preparation (preprocessing)
3. User Playlist Reconstruction using Machine Learning
4. Top-Year Playlist Reconstruction using Machine Learning
5. Reconstruction the Mlaylist Data
